agorascript
===========

A collection of scripts I've made that may or may not be useful. Currently they're being brushed up, but they should all do their intended function.


calc.py
-----------
A weighted grade calculator, using grades entered into a .txt file. Calculate what score is needed to get a desired grade.

music.py and id3.py
-----------
music.py formats all the files in a directory from "Title - Artist.mp3" to "Artist - Title.mp3", which was useful after the great Spotify HTML5 .mp3 disaster of '13.
id3.py uses the eyed3 module to add Artist and Song Name information into mp3 files' ID3 tags, based on their naming as "Artist - Title.mp3".

link.py
-----------
Changes raw links embedded in HTML into Google Doc Spreadsheet formulas, for easy copypasta.

txtconvert.py
-----------
Converts from CRLF to LF and vice versa.
